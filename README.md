# Personalized Medicine Recommendations Using Graph Neural Networks

## üìå Project Overview
This project explores the application of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**, specifically **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**, to **personalized medicine recommendations**. We utilize the **MIMIC-III** dataset to construct a **heterogeneous graph** representing patient histories, diagnoses, procedures, laboratory test results, and prescribed medications. Our goal is to develop an AI-driven **clinical decision support system** that recommends personalized treatments based on patient medical records.

## üìÇ Dataset: MIMIC-III
We use the **MIMIC-III** (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) dataset, which contains de-identified **electronic health records (EHRs)** from ICU patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The following tables are used:

| Table Name        | Selected Columns |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **PATIENTS**     | `subject_id`, `gender`, `dob`, `dod` (for age calculation) |
| **ADMISSIONS**   | `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `admittime`, `dischtime`, `ethnicity` |
| **DIAGNOSES_ICD** | `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `icd9_code`, `disease_category` (mapped using CCS) |
| **PROCEDURES_ICD** | `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `icd9_code`, `procedure_category` (mapped using CCS) |
| **LABEVENTS**    | `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `itemid`, `valuenum` (normalized using MinMaxScaler) |
| **PRESCRIPTIONS** | `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, `drug`, **PubMedBERT-encoded embeddings** |

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for graph-based modeling, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

1. **ICD-9 Disease and Procedure Mapping**  
   - **Diagnoses (`icd9_code`)** and **procedures (`icd9_code`)** are mapped to **higher-level categories** using **HCUP Clinical Classifications Software (CCS)**.
   - This reduces the sparsity of disease/procedure codes and improves model interpretability.

2. **Medication Normalization**  
   - Medication names from the **PRESCRIPTIONS** table are encoded using **PubMedBERT** embeddings.
   - These embeddings capture **semantic relationships** between drugs, improving the recommendation system.

3. **Laboratory Test Normalization**  
   - The `valuenum` column in the **LABEVENTS** table is **normalized** using `MinMaxScaler` to ensure consistency across different test types.

4. **Graph Construction (Planned)**  
   - The heterogeneous graph will consist of **nodes** (patients, diseases, medications, procedures, lab events) and **edges** capturing medical interactions (e.g., `diagnosed_with`, `prescribed`, `underwent`, `has_test`).

## üìå Planned Steps: Graph Construction and Model Training

1. **Graph Construction**  
   - Construct a **heterogeneous knowledge graph** using PyTorch Geometric.
   - Define **node embeddings** for patients, diseases, medications, and lab events.
   - Convert the graph to an **undirected format** to improve message passing.

2. **GAT Model Training (Upcoming)**  
   - Implement **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** to learn relationships in the medical graph.
   - Use **multi-head attention** to weigh different medical interactions.
   - Train using **cross-entropy loss** with **mini-batch training**.

3. **Evaluation and Baselines**  
   - Compare GAT against **logistic regression, random forest, and MLP classifiers**.
   - Use **precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC** for performance evaluation.
   - Conduct **ablation studies** to analyze the impact of different features.

## üìä Graphical Representation

A **heterogeneous medical graph** will be used to model the relationships between entities:

- **Nodes:** Patients, Diseases, Medications, Procedures, Lab Events  
- **Edges:** `Diagnosed_with`, `Prescribed`, `Underwent`, `Has_Test`  

## üöÄ Future Work

- **Train the GAT model** on the constructed graph.  
- **Fine-tune hyperparameters** (learning rate, number of attention heads, hidden layers).  
- **Improve explainability** by analyzing **attention weights** for disease-medication interactions.  
- **Deploy a recommendation system** for personalized medicine.
